  <h1>Brief History of CSS</h1>
    <ul>
      <li id='green'><span class='date'>1994:</span> The first work on style
    sheets started at CERN.</li>
      <li><span class='date'>December 1996:</span> CSS was proposed as W3C standard:
        <blockquote>"CSS1 defines the language in which style sheets are written and a set
        of properties that designers can use to describe how documents should be
        presented. The properties in CSS1 cover the most common screen-based
        presentations."</blockquote></li>
      </ul
    <p><span class='date'>November 1997:</span> The W3C released the first
        public CSS2 Working Draft. <strong>New features:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ability to specify how a document should be spoken when rendering HTML
      with a speech synthesizer.</li>
      <li>You can specify how loudly a phrase should be spoken, where pauses
      should be, voice characteristics, and where one speaker is physically
      in relation to others (for stereo effects.)</li>
      <li>You can insert sound clips before and after elements, for instance,
      to emphasize hypertext links.</li>
      <li>More complex positioning of text, images and other elements on the
      page.</li>
      <li>You can specify styles for printing and other media.</li>
      <li>Stylesheet for printing on paper may need to be different from one for
      presenting information on a screen.</li>
      <li>CSS2 lets authors associate different stylesheets for different media
      with the same document.</li>
      <li>Authors can control page breaks.</li>
      <li>Has widow and orphan control, just as for ordinary desktop publishing.</li>
      <li> For high-quality printing, crop marks can be printed outside the outer
      edges of the page box.</li>
      <li>Better specification of fonts for a document.</li>
        <ul><li>Font information can be used to download font subsets over the Web.</li></ul>
    </ol>
  <li><span class='date'>May 1998:</span> CSS2 specification becomes a W3C recommendation.</li>
  <li><span class='date'>2000:</span> Work on CSS3 was under way.</li>
  <!-- removing &quot; because it is useless -->
  <blockquote>CSS3 will, in
    effect, have all of the features that users expect
    from a desktop publishing environment, as well as a range of features
    especially suited to the context of an international and multimedia Web.
    <!-- again &quot; --></blockquote>
    <blockquote>CSS3 will also be modularized. For example, there might be one
    module consisting of properties having to do with fonts and text, and another
    module for properties concerned with colors, and so on.</blockquote>
