<h1>Brief History of CSS</h1>

<!-- changed the list setup -->

    <h2 id="green"><span class="date">1994:</span> The first work on style sheets started at CERN.</h2>
    <h2><span class="date">December 1996:</span> CSS was proposed as W3C standard.</h2>

<!-- changed this to a paragraph -->
<blockquote>CSS1 defines the language in which style sheets are written and a set of properties that designers can use to describe how documents should be presented. The properties in CSS1 cover the most common screen-based presentations.</blockquote>

<!-- and this to an h2 -->
<h2><span class="date">November 1997:</span> The W3C released the first public CSS2 Working Draft.</h2>
 </h3><strong>New features:</strong></h3>

<ul>
    <li>Ability to specify how a document should be spoken when rendering HTML with a speech synthesizer.</li>

    <li>You can specify how loudly a phrase should be spoken, where pauses should be, voice characteristics, and where one speaker is physically in relation to others (for stereo effects.)</li>

    <li>You can insert sound clips before and after elements, for instance, to emphasize hypertext links.</li>

    <li>More complex positioning of text, images and other elements on the page.</li>

    <li>You can position text in a box within a paragraph.</li>
    <li>You can position and "layer" material as though it was written on acetate sheets one on top of each other: most kinds of layout which are commonly found in magazines and other printed material are possible with CSS2.</li>

    <li>You can specify styles for printing and other media.</li>

    <li>Stylesheet for printing on paper may need to be different from one for presenting information on a screen.</li>
  </ul>
<!-- changed the list setup here as well -->

<h2>CSS2 lets authors associate different stylesheets for different media with the same document.</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Authors can control page breaks.</li>
    <li>Has widow and orphan control, just as for ordinary desktop publishing.</li>
    <li> For high-quality printing, crop marks can be printed outside the outer edges of the page box.</li>
    <li>Better specification of fonts for a document.</li>
    <li><span>Font information can be used to download font subsets over the Web.</span></li>
</ul>

  <h2><span class="date">May 1998:</span> CSS2 specification becomes a W3C recommendation.</h2>
  <h2><span class="date">2000:</span> Work on CSS3 was under way.</h2>


<blockquote>CSS3 will, in effect, have all of the features that users expect from a desktop publishing environment, as well as a range of features especially suited to the context of an international and multimedia Web.</blockquote>
<!-- changed to paragraph -->
  <div class="blocktest"><p>CSS3 will also be modularized. For example, there might be one module consisting of properties having to do with fonts and text, and another module for properties concerned with colors, and so on.</div></p>
