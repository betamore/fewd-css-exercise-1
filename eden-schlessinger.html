    <h1>Brief History of CSS</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>1994: The first work on style sheets started at CERN.</li>
      <div id="lin1"></div>
      <li>December 1996: CSS was proposed as W3C standard:
        <blockquote>
          "CSS1 defines the language in which style sheets are written and a set of properties that designers can use to describe how documents should be presented. The properties in CSS1 cover the most common screen-based presentations."
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>November 1997: The W3C released the first public CSS2 Working Draft.</li>
      <li>May 1998: CSS2 specification becomes a W3C recommendation.</li>
      <li>2000: Work on CSS3 was under way.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      &quot;CSS3 will, in effect, have all of the features that users expect from a desktop publishing environment, as well as a range of features especially suited to the context of an international and multimedia Web.&quot;
