    <h1>Brief History of CSS</h1>
    <ul>
        <li id="first-list">1994: The first work on style sheets started at CERN.</li>
        <li>
            <div class="date">December 1996</div>: CSS was proposed as W3C standard:
            <blockquote>
                "CSS1 defines the language in which style sheets are written and a set of properties that designers can
                use to describe how documents should be presented. The properties in CSS1 cover the most common
                screen-based presentations."
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="date">November 1997</div>: The W3C released the first public CSS2 Working Draft.
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="date">May 1998</div>: CSS2 specification becomes a W3C recommendation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="date">2000</div>: Work on CSS3 was under way.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
        &quot;CSS3 will, in effect, have all of the features that users expect from a desktop publishing environment, as
        well as a range of features especially suited to the context of an international and multimedia Web.&quot;
